NSQ with multi process Gevent.

[NSQ](https://nsq.io) is a distrbuted message queue.

[gnsq](https://github.com/wtolson/gnsq/) is a [Gevent](http://www.gevent.org/) powered NSQ library written in pure Python with fast asyncronous operations

Due the limitations of GIL in CPython, even with Gevent, `gnsq` can not handle high-volumn message with many topics and nsqd hosts. It's easy to hit 100% CPU usage for one core.

If we add number of consumer nodes for each topic, as the process number grows, so does the TCP connection established to each nsqd host. It's easy to hit tens of thousands of connections which adds a non-neglectable amount of coroutine context switch cost.

This `gnsq_mp` project implements a new multiprocess mode:

 - the `NsqMPController` process polls [lookupd](nsq.io/components/nsqlookupd.html) and spawns sub-process for each individuale nsqd connections.
 - the `NsqProcessWorker` sub-process connects to a single nsqd host and consumes message
 - sub-process are health-checked and automatically restarted if exits unexpectedly
 - sub-process will exit if became a orphan
 - sub-processes are by default set CPU affilinty with only 1 processor core.


# Usage

First of all, create your `worker.py` like this:

    
    from gnsq_mp import NsqProcessWorker

    class MyWorker(NsqProcessWorker):

        def handle_message(self, reader, message):
            print (message.body)

    if '__main__' == __name__:
        MyWorker.run(block=True)


Note the `worker.py` will be launched as a deparate process with parameters `topic`, `nsqd_addr` and `channel_name`. You should be able to test the script directly in shell.


Then create a master which spawns the `worker.py` dynamically with nsqlookupd results.

The source code should look like:


    from gnsq_mp import NsqMPController

    class MyController(NsqMPController):
        lookupd_http_addresses = [
            "http://10.1.1.1:4161",
            "http://10.1.1.2:4161",
            "http://10.1.1.3:4161",
        ]
        worker = 'worker.py'  # relative path to the script you created above

    MyController.run(topic="blah", channel_name="gnsq_mp#ephemeral")

# Install
